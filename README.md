Project: Pizza Sales Analysis

This project involved analyzing sales data from a pizza store. The dataset consists of four main CSV files containing information about orders, pizzas, and pizza types. By performing SQL queries and data analysis, key insights were extracted to help understand sales trends, popular pizzas, and customer preferences. Below is a brief description of the tables and the analysis performed:

1. orderdetail.csv: This file contains details of each pizza ordered, including the order ID, pizza ID, and quantity. It helps identify which pizzas were ordered and in what quantity.

2. orders.csv: This file provides information about the orders placed, including the order ID, date, and time. It is useful for analyzing when orders were placed and for identifying patterns in order frequency.

3. pizza_types.csv: This file contains details about the types of pizzas available, including their name, category (e.g., Chicken, Vegetarian), and ingredients. It is helpful in categorizing pizzas for deeper analysis based on type.

4. pizzas.csv: This file includes details of each specific pizza variant, such as the pizza type ID, size (e.g., small, medium, large), and price. This data was used to calculate revenue and understand the popularity of pizza sizes.
